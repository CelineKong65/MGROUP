            <section>2005</section>
            <p>In August 2005, Property Store was established in Malacca. Initially, our shop was not well known, but with increasing demand for rental properties, we became the only property seller offering this service. Our business grew rapidly as a result.</p>

            <section>2012</section>
            <p>2012 was challenging due to the opening of branches in Kuala Lumpur and Johor. Despite a significant drop in sales during the outbreak, our store maintained a comprehensive range of property services, attracting many customers.</p>

            <section>2019</section>
            <p>In 2019, the epidemic led to a significant drop in sales. We launched a website, facilitating online property inquiries, which have continued to grow in popularity as people seek properties without going out.</p>
