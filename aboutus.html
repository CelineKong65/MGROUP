                <section style="float: left;">2005</section>
                <p style="margin-left: 10%;">In August 2005, Property Store was established in Malacca.
                At the beginning, our property shop was not well known, but once the demand for rental properties gradually increased,
                while other property shops did not provide this service, our shop became the only property seller with rental options.
                After that, more and more people came to our store to inquire, which led to a sharp increase in business.
                From then on, our shop began to offer more and more property services and gained the support of many people.

                <section style="float: right;">2012</section>
                <p style="margin-right: 10%;">2012 was a challenging year for our property shop because we opened two branches in Kuala Lumpur and Johor respectively.</p>
                <p style="margin-right: 10%;">Our store has also attracted many customers because of its comprehensive range of property services and has become the property store with the highest sales volume.
                However, the outbreak caused a significant drop in sales.

                <p style="margin-left: 10%;">In 2019, decreasing sales due to the sudden outbreak of the epidemic also had a huge impact. </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 10%;">Therefore, the store created a website to facilitate customers to inquire about properties online.
                With the launch of the website, property inquiries gradually increased.
                Until now, more and more people use our website to find the properties they need in order not to go out.
